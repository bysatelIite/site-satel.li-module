# satel.li-module

essentially the 'remote_theme' for 'site-satel.li' repositories. 
an easy way to update some standard layouts and default CSS files across multiple of my sites. much more preferred than a git submodule i think. 

most of the sites are composed of these three files: 

- 200 : /te.html
- 307 : /index.html
- 404 : /404.html

'satel.li' sites are all 'suffixed' with a 'te' to form the word 'satellite'. as such, the index of the site is not the 'true' index, but the 'te' is. all sites use a simple redirect to the 'te' page.
