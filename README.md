# satel.li-module

This is the primary asset folder for all of satel.li/te's domains and subdomains. 
It contains the basic Jekyll structure and basic building blocks & styles that are required. 

every subdomain of 'satel.li' has three essential components: 

- direct
- redirect 
- 404 

the module defines these three pages and outputs them into the site directory.
